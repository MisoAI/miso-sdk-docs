title: Guides for building your Answers UI
---

You can integrate Miso Answers into your website in two steps:

1. Create an **answers** page to host the **ask** module, which responds to user questions.
1. In your article pages, add an **explore** module to display related questions against the articles that lead to the **answers** page.

## Build your ask module

{% include 'section/ui-ask-module-guide.md' %}

## Build your explore module

Follow the [guide]({{ '/answers/explore/' | url }}).
