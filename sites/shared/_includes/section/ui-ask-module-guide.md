There are three ways to build your ask module:

#### The standard UI solution

* Features are identical to the [demo]({{ '/demo/latest/ask/answers/' | url }}).
* Can be done with 2 lines of HTML.
* Limited customization: CSS, texts.
* Follow the [guide]({{ '/answers/ask/standard/quick-start/' | url }}).

#### The custom UI solution

* Fully customizable: HTML, CSS, texts, logic.
* Follow the [guide]({{ '/answers/ask/custom/quick-start/' | url }}).

#### Build from scratch

You can also build your UI from scratch, with the help of [SDK]({{ '/sdk/' | url }}) to call Miso API.
