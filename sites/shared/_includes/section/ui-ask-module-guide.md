There are two ways to build your ask module:

#### Use the built-in UI elements

* Fully customizable: HTML, CSS, texts, logic.
* Follow the [guide]({{ '/answers/ask/quick-start/' | url }}).

#### Build from scratch

You can also build your UI from scratch, without the assistance of SDK UI elements. You may want to explore the following references:

* The SDK [API]({{ '/answers/api/' | url }}) section
* [Technology stack]({{ '/advanced/technology/' | url }})
* [Progressive markdown tools]({{ '/advanced/progressive-markdown-tools/' | url }})

#### Legacy `combo` UI solution

The SDK used to offer a `combo` UI solution which aimed for simplicity. It is now deprecated due to lack for extensibility but still maintained.

* Can be done with 2 lines of HTML.
* Limited customization: CSS, texts.
* Follow the [guide]({{ '/answers/ask/combo/quick-start/' | url }}).
